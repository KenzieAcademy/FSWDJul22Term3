# Term 3 Kickoff!

## Term Goal
The goal of Term 3 is to prepare you for the next step in your journey as developers: finding a job! 

You have spent the past 6+ months learning the hard skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, MongoDB, etc.

Now it's time to shift gears and focus the more abstract side of software development. This term will help prepare you by introducing you to some of the behind-the-scenes aspects of full stack web development, such as:
- Researching new topics
- Databases
- Cloud Infrastructure
- DevOps
- Debugging
- The Design Process and the SDLC

And some of the tools that you'll need to start getting yourself out there:
- Building a portfolio
- Figuring out which jobs to apply for
- Marketing yourself

## Challenges
In addition to these topics, you will be tasked with completing a series of coding challenges. The challenges are in levels:
- Basic Challenges
- Intermediate Challenges
- Advanced Challenges

Most basic challenges have a subsequent intermediate challenge, and most intermediate challenges have a subsequent advanced challenge.

Unlike Activities and Assessments, the Challenges can be resubmitted for a higher grade.

#### Basic Challenges
You must complete a total of 8 basic challenges by the end of Course 1 (Feb 20).

#### Intermediate Challenges
You must complete a total of 4 intermediate challenges by the end of Course 2 (Mar 20). In order to attempt an Intermediate Challenge, you must first complete its Basic Challenge (there are at least one or two instances of Intermediate challenges with no associated Basic challenges, so obviously that's not the case for these).

#### Advanced Challenges
You must complete a total of 2 advanced challenges by the end of Course 3 (Apr 14). In order to attempt an Advanced Challenge, you must first complete its Intermediate Challenge.

### Choosing Which Challenges to Complete
It is not recommended that you approach challenges in terms of difficulty. They are called Challenges for a reason. 

The coding challenges are set up in a way that different challenges are meant to expose you to a different aspect of Software Engineering: 

Focus | Basic | Intermediate | Advanced
--- | --- | --- | ---
PM* | Capstone, Assignments | Capstone, Assignments | Capstone, Assignments
Game | Maze, Tower of Hanoi | Tower of Hanoi, Tic Tac Toe | Maze, Tower of Hanoi, Tic Tac Toe
UI/UX | Responsive Layout | Responsive Layout |
Test | Unit Testing | Unit Testing | Unit Testing
GenDev | Anagrams, Arithmetic, Nums to Words, Dates & Times, Loops & Arrays, Mult. Table, Array Methods | Anagrams, Nums to Words, Dates & Times, Mult. Table, Pig Latin, Array Methods | Anagrams, Arithmetic, Nums to Words, Pig Latin
FSWD | Data Modeling | Data Modeling | Data Modeling

## Capstone
Final Project, essentially. You have complete freedom here.
